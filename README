Wx-Perl-Imagick

This class is meant to be a replacement for Wx::Image, adding all functionality of Image::Magick. Hence
the name Wx::Perl::Imagick.
Most of the API of Wx::Image has been copied for backwards compatibility, but you can also call any method
of Image::Magick on a constructed Wx::Perl::Magick instance. This will greatly improve the possibilities
you have with an image in wxPerl.
